Communication
=============

When joining a new community, it can be tough to figure out *where* to ask questions, provide feedback, or help out. Don't worry! As long as you're respectful and follow our :ref:`code-of-conduct`, we're happy to have you!

Here are some guidelines regarding the best way to get in touch or contribute. Do note that Open States is a volunteer-powered project, and all of the core developers have day jobs; we're excited to talk to you, but it may sometimes take a bit of time to get back to you.

Recommendations
-----------------

**Want to ask a general question, have a conversation, or listen in to the community?**

    The best place is our `Discourse Forum <https://discourse.openstates.org/>`_. This is the main place for Open States discussion. The core team and many other contributors are present there, and we're usually able to answer questions in a timely fashion.

**Have a private or financial question, or a security concern?**

    Email `contact@openstates.org <mailto:contact@openstates.org>`_; only the administrative team can see these.

**Want to contribute to the project?**

    We have a private Slack that we can invite you to.  If you're interested in an invite, introduce yourself in an email to `contact@openstates.org <mailto:contact@openstates.org>`_.


**Have you found an error or issue in the Open States data?**

    File an issue on `our bug tracker <https://github.com/openstates/openstates/issues>`_.  And before you do, quickly check whether anyone else there has already reported the same bug.

**Have a technical issue not related to the data itself?**

    Try to find the appropriate repository in `our GitHub organization <https://github.com/openstates>`_, and file an issue there. For example:

        * openstates.org: https://github.com/openstates/openstates.org/issues/
        * our documentation: https://github.com/openstates/documentation/issues/


Discouraged Methods of Communication
------------------------------------

Please *avoid* using these channels to get in touch with us:

**Personal email addresses of Open States developers**

    Please respect our boundaries & refrain from contacting any of the developers directly, unless we ask you to do so.

**Twitter (or any other social media)**

    We mainly use the `@openstates twitter account <https://twitter.com/openstates>`_ to make announcements, and don't have the resources to provide technical support or other feedback on Twitter.
