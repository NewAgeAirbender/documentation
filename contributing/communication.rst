Communication
=============

When joining a new community, it can be tough to figure out *where* to ask questions, provide feedback, or help out. Don't worry! As long as you're respectful and follow our :ref:`code-of-conduct`, we're happy to have you!

Here are some guidelines regarding the best way to get in touch or contribute. Do note that Open States is a volunteer-powered project, and all of the core developers have day jobs; we're excited to talk to you, but it may sometimes take a bit of time to get back to you.

Recommendations
-----------------

.. _getting-help:

**Want to ask a general question, have a conversation, or keep up with the community?**

    The best place is our `Discussion Forum <https://github.com/openstates/issues/discussions>`_. This is the main place for Open States discussion. The core team and many other contributors are present there, and we're usually able to answer questions in a timely fashion.

**Have a private or financial question, or a security concern?**

    Email `contact@openstates.org <mailto:contact@openstates.org>`_; only the administrative team can see these.

**Have you found an error or issue in the Open States data?**
**Have a technical issue not related to the data itself?**

    File an issue on `our bug tracker <https://github.com/openstates/issues/issues>`_.  And before you do, quickly check whether anyone else there has already reported the same bug.


**Want to contribute to the project more regularly?**

    We also have a Slack that you can join.  It is not the best place for asking questions better handled by filing an issue or opening a conversation on GitHub, but you're welcome to `join if you're interested in being a part of the community <https://join.slack.com/t/open-states/shared_invite/zt-njrpuaoi-JP0bROOFtZLdtNHN3LsuFg>`_.



Discouraged Methods of Communication
------------------------------------

Please *avoid* using these channels to get in touch with us:

**Personal email addresses of Open States developers**

    Please respect our boundaries & refrain from contacting any of the developers directly, unless we ask you to do so.

**Twitter (or any other social media)**

    We mainly use the `@openstates twitter account <https://twitter.com/openstates>`_ to make announcements, and don't have the resources to provide technical support or other feedback on Twitter.
