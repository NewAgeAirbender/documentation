Overview & Roadmap
==================

Open States is a fairly large & somewhat complex project comprised of many moving parts with a long history.

As you look to contribute, it may be beneficial to understand a little bit about the various components.

Repositories
------------

These repositories make up the core of the project, if you're looking to contribute there's a 90% chance one of these is what you're looking for.

- `openstates`_ - Open States bill & vote scrapers.
- `people`_ - Open States People data, maintained as editable YAML files
- `text-extraction`_ - Text extraction powering full text search.
- `openstates.org`_ - Powers https://openstates.org/ website & API.
- `metadata`_ - Data on states and their districts, etc. that changes rarely.
- `documentation`_ - https://docs.openstates.org/ (you're reading it now)

These repositories are other pieces of our infrastructure, but are generally not interesting to the average person.

- `task-definitions`_ - Definitions for bobsled.
- `maintenance-scripts`_ - Internal scripts used for various maintenance tasks.
- `indiana-docs`_ - A proxy for fetching Indianaâ€™s docs without API key.
- `blog`_ - https://blog.openstates.org/
- `openstates-district-maps`_ - Source for generating Open States' map tiles.
