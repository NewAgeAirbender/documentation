.. _district-search:

District Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The district search method requires a ``state`` and can optionally also
take a ``chamber`` as part of the URL.

The method returns a list of district objects with the following fields:

-  ``abbr`` State abbreviation.
-  ``boundary_id`` boundary\_id used in :ref:`district-detail`
-  ``chamber`` Whether this district belongs to the upper or lower
   chamber.
-  ``id`` A unique ID for this district (separate from boundary\_id).
-  ``legislators`` List of legislators that serve in this district. (may
   be more than one if ``num_seats`` > 1)
-  ``name`` Name of the district (e.g. '14', '33A', 'Fifth Suffolk')
-  ``num_seats`` Number of legislators that are elected to this seat.
   Generally one, but will be 2 or more if the seat is a multi-member
   district.

**Example:**
:ref:`openstates.org/api/v1/districts/nc/lower/ <district-search-example>`

.. _district-detail:

District Boundary Lookup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This method returns an full district object, including the boundary
given a ``boundary id``.

The returned object has the following fields:

-  ``abbr`` State abbreviation.
-  ``bbox`` A bounding box composed of a list of two (long, lat) points.
   The first point is the upper left corner, and the second point is the
   lower right.
-  ``boundary_id`` boundary\_id for this boundary.
-  ``chamber`` Whether this district belongs to the upper or lower
   chamber.
-  ``id`` A unique ID for this district (separate from boundary\_id).
-  ``name`` Name of the district (e.g. '14', '33A', 'Fifth Suffolk')
-  ``num_seats`` Number of legislators that are elected to this seat.
   Generally one, but will be 2 or more if the seat is a multi-member
   district.
-  ``region`` A dictionary of the following values:

   -  ``center_lat`` Center latitude of the bounding box.
   -  ``center_lon`` Center longitude of the bounding box.
   -  ``lat_delta`` Equivalent to
      max(\ ``latitude``)-min(\ ``latitude``)
   -  ``lon_delta`` Equivalent to
      max(\ ``longitude``)-min(\ ``longitude``)

-  ``shape`` List of polygons, each of which is a GeoJSON-like list of
   coordinates describing a single polygon.
