Open States API
===============

There are multiple versions of the Open States API.  :ref:`v3` and :ref:`v2` are both supported and roughly equal in capability.  The main difference is that API v2 is a GraphQL API while API v3 is a more traditional JSON API.


API v1 Deprecation
------------------

As of November 2018 we began the process of removing lesser-used portions of this API.  New applications should use API v2 or v3.

As of November 2020, API v1 is no longer supported.  Existing use cases may continue as-is, but endpoints will be turned off in 2021.  See the `API v3 announcement <https://blog.openstates.org/open-states-api-v3/>`_ for more details.
