Main Concepts
=============

The main concepts are defined below:

Jurisdiction
  Essentially just another word for "State" in our context.  (Includes DC and Puerto Rico.)

Session (aka LegislativeSession)
  A period of time in a legislature where the same members serve together, typically punctuated by elections.  All bills in a session will be uniquely numbered.  (e.g. HB 1 in the 2017 session is typically not the same bill as in the 2019 session)

Bill
  Represents all types of legislation whether it is a bill, resolution, etc.

Vote (aka VoteEvent)
  A vote among members of the legislature, typically an entire chamber but can also be a committee vote.

Person (aka Legislator)
  Any person that is associated with the legislature.

Organization
  A generic term used to represent a few different concepts: legislatures, chambers, committees, and political parties.

Post
  A particular role within an organization, typically used to represent a seat in the legislature.  (e.g. the District 4 post in the North Carolina Senate Organization)

Membership
  Ties a Person to a Post for a duration of time.
