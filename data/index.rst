Understanding the Data
======================

Open States data adheres to a schema that has evolved over our 11+ years of working with legislative data. 
Our goal is to provide as much uniformity across states as possible while still allowing for the wide diversity of legislative processes between the states.

These docs both catalog the schema and attempt to explain some of those choices, particularly where they might be surprising.
