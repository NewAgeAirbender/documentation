People CSVs
===========

As of April 2019 we are making experimental CSV files of **current** legislators available.

The latest files are available via: https://github.com/openstates/people/tree/master/csv 

**Note:** Due to the limitations of the CSV format we can't include every field we collect in these files.  The goal here is to make a file that has the fields people are most likely to want.
The same Git repository also has YAML files available if you'd like historical roles, etc.

If you're using these files, you can give feedback by opening a GitHub issue: https://github.com/openstates/people/issues
