People CSVs
===========

As of April 2019 we are making experimental CSV files of **current** legislators available.

The latest files are available via: https://github.com/openstates/people/tree/master/csv 

**Note:** Due to the limitations of CSV data in these files is not 100% complete.  That repository also has
YAML files available if you need complete files.

If you're using these files, you can give feedback by opening a GitHub issue: https://github.com/openstates/people/issues
